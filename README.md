CSV configurations
------------------

in the protected variable `$ _Entry` you creat the structure of the csv file

- on the `header` here the column names are written after the other.

Individual column name with `;` separately.

if you need a blank line between the header and the data records, write `\n` in the last column name.

- on the `fields` here are written contents of the column.

Individual records are written to `#oxid#`  and separated by `|`.

`#oxid#+#oxtitle#` so will be displayed more conten  in a column.

`#oxshortdesc#/#oxlongdesc#` then the second output if the first is not available.

- on the `separator` here the delimiter for the csv file is entered.

various data feeds need different requirements to be able to read the csv file to which with the separator structure, the rows and columns will be defined.

own configurations
------------------

in the individual Exportern can be seen all functions from the **marmCsvExporter.php** override and extend.

add a non exist column, but how?

as example: we want the attribute color of the individual variants product

in the protected variable `$ _Entry`

- In `header`, we write the new column name `color`.

- In `fields` comes a new marker `#color#`.

- Now has the `getDataByMarker($marker)` from the **marmCsvExporter.php**�be extended in our exporter to a marker.

- The new marker we give a new function.

- And finally we actually function in our exporter written�reads out the color of the variants products and passes the marker.
